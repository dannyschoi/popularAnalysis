# popularAnalysis

## Introduction

This project tries to predict Youtube's trending videos using video data metrics from Youtube.  
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used because sequences of arbitrary length are input signals.  
Tensorflow and Keras are used to make the models.  
The dataset used is from Kaggle and can be updated using the Kaggle API.
